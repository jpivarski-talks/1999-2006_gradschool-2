.TH XSANDBOX 1 "July, 14 2001" "xsandbox"
.SH NAME
xsandbox \- physics-based distraction
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B
xsandbox
[\fIsandbox options...\fR] [\fIGTK options...\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBxsandbox\fR renders a sandbox in an X11 window, buffeted by ocean
waves.
.PP
Sand may be added with the left mouse button, removed with the right
mouse button, and pushed around (leveling peaks) with the middle
button.
.PP
Water is simulated with adjustable resolution by a dispersive Laplace
equation, subject to gravity. Water boundary conditions are periodic
at the four edges of the window, and the water height of the bottom
edge is sinusoidally driven to represent the ocean.
.PP
Some parameters can be set at startup time (see \fBSANDBOX
OPTIONS\fR), and others can be changed while \fBxsandbox\fR is running
(see \fBKEYBOARD COMMANDS\fR).
.SH SANDBOX OPTIONS
.TP 8
.B \fI\-geom\fR, \fI\-\-geometry\fR \fB+x+y|wXh[+x+y]\fR (default = 400x300)
This is the standard X11 geometry argument for setting the size and
location of the window. (Setting the window location doesn't yet
work. See \fBKNOWN BUGS\fR)
.TP 8
.B \fI\-nw\fR, \fI\-\-no\-water\fR
Create a window filled with sand but no water.
.TP 8
.B \fI\-wp\fR, \fI\-\-water\-pixelation\fR \fBint\fR (default = 3)
Set the width and height of a single water pixel. Only 2, 3 and 4 are
suggested.
.TP 8
.B \fI\-wc\fR, \fI\-\-water\-coupling\fR \fBfloat\fR (default = 0.45)
Set the water coupling constant (square of wave-propagation speed). It
is suggested that a lower value than the default is used, if any.
.TP 8
.B \fI\-wd\fR, \fI\-\-water\-dissipation\fR \fBfloat\fR (default = 0.05)
Set the level of energy dissipation. Values higher than the default
are suggested, if any.
.TP 8
.B \fI\-u\fR, \fI\-\-update\-time\fR \fBint\fR (default = 100)
Set the time in milliseconds between calls to update the water. Only
use small values on fast machines.
.TP 8
.B \fI\-nh\fR, \fI\-\-no\-hill\fR
Start the sand distribution with no hill. This option is suggested if
you plan to resize the window while the program is running (see
\fBKNOWN BUGS\fR).
.TP 8
.B \fI\-nb\fR, \fI\-\-no\-bumps\fR
Don't create initial anisotropies in the sand distribution, saving
time in startup at the expense of realism.
.TP 8
.B \fI\-amp\fR, \fI\-\-ocean\-amplitude\fR \fBfloat\fR (default = 1.0)
Set the amplitude of ocean waves in units of a suggested value.
.TP 8
.B \fI\-per\fR, \fI\-\-ocean\-period\fR \fBfloat\fR (default = 20.0)
Set the period of ocean waves in seconds.
.SH GTK OPTIONS
.PP
Since \fBxsandbox\fR uses GTK to handle the X11 interface, it has
inherited the standard suite of GTK options. They will be listed but
not described here.
.TP 8
.B \fI\-\-gtk\-module\fR
.TP 8
.B \fI\-\-g\-fatal\-warnings\fR
.TP 8
.B \fI\-\-gtk\-debug\fR
.TP 8
.B \fI\-\-gtk\-no\-debug\fR
.TP 8
.B \fI\-\-gdk\-debug\fR
.TP 8
.B \fI\-\-gdk\-no\-debug\fR
.TP 8
.B \fI\-\-display\fR

.B \fI\-\-class\fR
.SH MOUSE COMMANDS
.PP
While \fBxsandbox\fR is running, the mouse is used as a paintbrush to
add, remove or push sand. The brush acts when a mouse button is
pressed or held down while moving (but not when it is held down and
stationary).
.TP 8
.B \fBLeft Mouse Button \- Add Sand\fR
The sand height is increased in a Gaussian-distributed region around
the cursor.
.TP 8
.B \fBMiddle Mouse Button \- Push Sand\fR
The sand height is flattened to a given level (the level of the sand
where the push started). Any sand that was previously above this level
is pushed by the brush in a clump ahead of the direction of
motion. This is the only of the three brushes which conserves the
quantity of sand.
.TP 8
.B \fBRight Mouse Button \- Remove Sand\fR
The sand height is decreased in a Gaussian-distributed region around
the cursor.
.SH KEYBOARD COMMANDS
.PP
If one of the following keys are clicked in the window's focus,
\fBxsandbox\fR will perform the associated action.
.TP 8
.B \fB\fIq\fB or \fIQ\fB \- Quit\fR
\fBxsandbox\fR exits normally.
.TP 8
.B \fB\fIp\fB or \fIP\fB \- Pause\fR
Pause or unpause the water animation.
.TP 8
.B \fB\fIr\fB or \fIR\fB \- Resume\fR
Resume the water animation.
.TP 8
.B \fB\fI>\fB or \fI<\fB \- Rotate Light Source\fR
Increase or decrease the angle of the light source by ten
degrees. Each time it is clicked, the entire window must be redrawn,
so be careful to avoid autorepeating keys.
.TP 8
.B \fB\fIspacebar\fB \- Toggle Contour Lines\fR
Turn on or off the contour lines used to indicate sand elevation.
.SH KNOWN BUGS
.PP
Setting the window location with GTK doesn't work. I may be using the
wrong command or I may be using it at the wrong time.
.PP
Due to another GTK anachronism, the window size cannot be made smaller
than the size it has at startup time.
.PP
The way that the sand field responds to new area (by an enlargement of
the window) is naive and undesirably discontinuous. Changing the
window size is only suggested in the mode specified by the \fI\-nh\fR
option (no hill\-\- a level starting distribution).
