%  File: imag:/users/local/a2ps/header.ps
%  Created: Tue Nov 29 12:14:02 1988 by miguel@imag (Miguel Santana)
%  Version: 2.0
%  Description: PostScript prolog for a2ps ascii to PostScript program.
% 
%  Edit History:
%  - Original version by evan@csli (Evan Kirshenbaum).
%  - Modified by miguel@imag to:
%    1) Correct an overflow bug when printing page number 10 (operator
%	cvs).
%    2) Define two other variables (sheetwidth, sheetheight) describing
%	the physical page (by default A4 format).
%    3) Minor changes (reorganization, comments, etc).
%  - Modified by tullemans@apolloway.prl.philips.nl
%    1) Correct stack overflows with regard to operators cvs and copy.
%       The resulting substrings where in some cases not popped off 
%       the stack, what can result in a stack overflow.
%    2) Replaced copypage and erasepage by showpage. Page througput
%       degrades severely (see red book page 140) on our ps-printer
%       after printing sheet 16 (i.e. page 8) of a file which was 
%       actually bigger. For this purpose the definitions of startdoc
%       and startpage are changed.
%  - Modified by Tim Clark <T.Clark@uk.ac.warwick> to:
%    1) Print one page per sheet (portrait) as an option.
%    2) Reduce size of file name heading, if it's too big.
%    3) Save and restore PostScript state at begining/end. It now uses
%	conventional %%Page %%Trailer markers.
%    4) Print one wide page per sheet in landscape mode as an option.
%  - Modified by miguel@imag.fr to
%    1) Add new option to print n copies of a file.
%    2) Add new option to suppress heading printing.
%    3) Add new option to suppress page surrounding border printing.
%    4) Add new option to change font size. Number of lines and columns
%	are now automatically adjusted, depending on font size and
%	printing mode used.
%    5) Minor changes (best layout, usage message, etc).

(20    Spin-1/2 particles, when measured, will only ever be found in a +1/2) s
(21    or a -1/2 state, never spin 0. To conserve angular momentum, if one of) s
(22    them is found in a +1/2 state, the other MUST be found in a -1/2) s
(23    state, if the measurement is done along the same axis.) s
(24    ) s

(29           device A      \\         spin-0 state         /     device B) s
(30    ) s
(31    Experimentally, this is done with photons \(spin-1 particles\). The same) s
(32    logic applies \(a photon will never be found with a spin of zero along) s
(33    any axis\) but the derivation is more involved. Aspect and Grangier in) s
(34    the 70's did exactly the above with photon pairs from a decaying) s
(35    nucleus.) s
(36    ) s
(37    The two detectors are placed far enough apart that the time to measure) s
(38    and record a spin measurement is shorter than the time for a signal at) s
(39    speed c to propogate from one detector to the other.) s
(40    ) s
(41    Device A will be measuring spins along the z axis \(perpendicular to) s
(42    the beamline\). Device B will be measuring spin along an axis which is) s
(43    perpendicular to the beamline but an angle theta from the z axis. When) s
(44    theta is zero, device B will always measure a spin opposite to the) s
(45    spin measured by device A \(exactly anti-correlated\), by conservation) s
(46    of angular momentum. When theta is pi/2, device B will measure a spin) s
(47    which is completely uncorrelated with the measurement of device A. For) s
(48    intermediate values of theta, the value will be partially correlated.) s
(49    Here is the explaination and calculation given by quantum mechanics:) s
(50    ) s
(51    \(I decided to include all the background to really understand the) s
(52    calculation... I don't remember there being any vector space) s
(53    formulation of QM in physics 3.\)) s
(54    ) s
(55    The state of a particle is given by a normalized vector in a vector) s
(56    space. For spin-1/2 particles \(as it is for spin-1 particles\), this) s
(57    vector space \(or the relevant part of it\) is two-dimensional. If we) s
(58    choose a basis in this vector space to be "spin measurements in the) s
(59    z-direction", then one basis vector may be associated with "spin =) s
(60    +1/2" and the other with "spin = -1/2". An unobserved particle may) s
(61    take a state represented by any normalized vector in this space, but) s
(62    when the particle is observed, it is then projected onto the "spin) s
(63    measurements in teh z-direction" basis vectors. The component on the) s
(64    "spin = +1/2" vector is interpreted as the sqrt of the probability of) s
(65    finding the particle in the +1/2 state. Alternatively, we can say) s
(66    that the probability of getting a measurement corresponding to state x) s
(67    from a particle which was originally in a state y is the \(square of) s
(68    the\) inner product                                2) s
(69                       P\( measurement x \) == \( x . y \)) s
(70    ) s
(71    The two particles in our experimental apparatus are in an entangled) s
(72    state--- neither particle can be expressed in terms of a state alone,) s
(73    the system of both particles together are expressed as the following) s

(78    where the vector space is a four-dimensional space. This space is) s
(79    spanned by the following set of orthonormal basis vectors:) s
(80      "A = +1/2, B = +1/2"    A measures spin +1/2 zhat, B has +1/2 zhat) s
(81      "A = +1/2, B = -1/2"    A measures spin +1/2 zhat, B has -1/2 zhat) s

(87      \( "A = +1/2, B = -1/2"  .  y \)^2  ==  1/2) s

(89      \( "A = -1/2, B = -1/2"  .  y \)^2  ==  0) s
(90    because you'll never see A and B with the same spin \(theta=0\), and) s
(91    you'll see either of the two antiparallel combinations with equal) s
(92    probability. The axiom of probability that) s
(93                    sum of all disjoint probabilities == 1) s
(94    is equivalent to the completeness relation of basis vectors that span) s
(95    a space.) s
(96    ) s
(97    Now, when you do a spin measurement of a particle NOT along the) s
(98    z-axis, that measurement picks a different basis set. It can be) s
(99    derived that the unitary transformation from the "spin measurement in) s

(115   Our entangled state y is expressed \(above\) in terms of the theta=0) s
(116   basis. The measurement is going to pick out basis vectors in a) s
(117   non-zero theta basis, so we need to inner product y onto transformed) s

(125             P\( A = -1/2, B = -1/2 \) == sin^2\( theta / 2 \) / 2) s
(126   These add up to one and quantify a correlation that continuously) s
(127   varies with theta from perfect anticorrelation at theta=0 to being) s
(128   perfectly uncorrelated at theta=pi/2.) s
(129   ) s
(130   This is the quantum mechanical prediction. Notice that I haven't) s
(131   assumed that any more fundumental information exists about the state) s
(132   of a particle other than a recipe for calculating the probabilities) s
(133   for a set of results, given a measurement technique. We can think of) s
(134   the quantum mechanical description of the state as supplying a) s
(135   function from experimental setup \(angle theta of detector B\) to a set) s

(138   y.\)) s
(139   ) s
(140   It would seem that this is not enough: for a particle in some given) s
(141   state, there must exist a function from experimental setup to the) s
(142   result of the measurement, even if we don't know what that function) s
(143   is. This is what you described, thinking that there was conflict) s

(169   Even in this deterministic theory, it is not necessarily possible to) s
