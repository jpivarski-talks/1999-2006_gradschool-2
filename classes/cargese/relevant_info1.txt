Now I think that either Nice or Marseille is best.

Syracuse --> Nice:        $1000 - $1100  Continental - SN Brussels, US Airways - Lufthansa, United Airlines... many changes!
Syracuse --> Marseilles:  $1000 - $1100  Continental - SN Brussels, US Airways - Lufthansa, United Airlines... many changes!

New York City is a better embarkment point.

Marseille is where Roland will be, and it also has a train
connection.  I think New York City <--> Marseilles is best.

22nd: $930 - $945 Lufthansa, Delta, Air France
23rd: $930 - $945 Lufthansa, Delta, Air France

29th: $930 - $945 Lufthansa, Delta, Air France
30st: $908 - $945 Lufthansa, Delta, Air France
31st: $930 - $945 Lufthansa, Delta, Air France

Only matters in the slightest.

16th - 30th is similar... I must be beyond some plateau.
