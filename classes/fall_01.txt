T&AM 610 Methods of Applied Mathematics I

     Fall. 3 credits. Intended for beginning graduate students in
     engineering and science. An intensive course, requiring more time
     than is normally available to undergraduates (see T&AM 310-311)
     but open to exceptional undergraduates with permission of
     instructor.

Emphasis is on applications. Linear algebra, calculus of several
variables, vector analysis, series, ordinary differential equations,
complex variables.

MATH 615-616 Mathematical Methods In Physics

     NOT OFFERED THIS YEAR 615, fall; 616, spring. 4 credits each.
     Intended for graduate students in physics or related fields who
     have had a strong advanced calculus course and at least 2 years
     of general physics. A knowledge of the elements of finite
     dimensional vector space theory, complex variables, separation of
     variables in partial differential equations, and Fourier series
     will be assumed. Undergraduates will be admitted only with
     permission of instructor. Mathematics 615 is a prerequisite for
     616. Not offered 2000-2001.

Topics designed to give a working knowledge of the principal
mathematical methods used in advanced physics. 615: Hilbert space,
generalized functions, Fourier transform, Sturm-Liouville problem in
ODE, Green's functions, asymptotic expansions. 616: Linear operators.
Differential operators and integral operators, the equations and
eigenvalue problems connected with them and the special functions
arising from them. Elements of group theory. The rotation group and
its representations.
