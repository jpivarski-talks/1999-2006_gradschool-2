#  You have to set the number of model, which you'd like to use.
#  The model number corresponds the string number of the model

model number: 4

#  In the process string you can use model particles or particles 
#  from a composite particles list of the model.
process: e,E->m,M

#  Energy of collision in c.m.s. of the colliding particles.
energy(GeV): 14000
