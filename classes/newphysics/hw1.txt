Parameters of the Standard Model in CompHEP:

EE (equivalent to alpha): perhaps the most precisely-known number in
physics?  If there have been any advances since 2002, it would only
matter in the digits that are being truncated anyway.  Maybe we need a
different number if we're simulating HEP in ancient stars.

GG ($\alpha_s$): this was ``measured'' by an unquenched lattice QCD
calculation a few years ago (comparison of lattice results with data),
but I think that was also before 2002.  Could be in trouble if there's
something wrong with the improved actions.

SW (Weinberg angle): kaon decay has large statistics from fixed-target
experiments.  My (2000) PDG gives a 1.5\% error.

s12, s23, s13 (other CKM elements): I know a lot of people who are
working on these; this will need a lot of updating in the near future.
I'm a little confused: I thought {\tt s12} $\times \sqrt{1-\mbox{\tt
s13}^2}$ is the same thing as {\tt SW}.  But there have to be four CKM
parameters in all, so I guess it works out somehow.

MZ, wZ, wW (mass and width of W, Z bosons): won't be getting any
better than the LEP values anytime soon.

Mm: there has been ample opportunity to get this right.

Mtau: CLEO-c might measure this in a few years.

I suppose electrons are massless.

Mc, Mb: may be different if heavy quark expansion gets revised.

Ms: determined from lattice QCD the same way as $\alpha_s$--- so it
depends on the validity of the improved actions.

Mtop, wtop: FermiLab direct measurements and LEP precision
electro-weak data measure this, and these values are sure to be
revised with LHC direct measurements.  (And from class today, they may
be revised just from re-analysis!)

MH, wH: are only guesses.  I expect we'll be changing these a lot.
