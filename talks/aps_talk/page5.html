<h2>Before any data was taken, the effects of random jitter (high
probability, small jump size) and random jumps (low probability, large
size) were studied.</h2>

<h3>0.2 MeV - 0.3 MeV jitter has been deemed tolerable.</h3>

<h3>Beam energy calibration is actively being studied, and is read out
and recorded every ten minutes for this purpose.</h3>
