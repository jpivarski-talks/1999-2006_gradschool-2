1. Cosmological perspective, observations, and hypotheses

   A. Perspective: on a universal scale, matter is a diffuse, homogeneous fluid

      * Granularity appears on the "small" scale of ~500 million light-years

   B. Observation: fluid is uniform (1:10^5) and flowing away from us (1929)

      * Can measure recession velocity easily (Doppler shift in atomic spectra),
        distance with more difficulty (variety of techniques)

      * Recession velocity is proportional to distance!
      
[blackboard]

   C. Hypotheses

      * Radial distribution of matter around Earth, with matter receeding from
        us (philosophically disfavored)

      * Distribution is homogeneous with the whole thing spreading out

        - Yields linear relationship between velocity and distance

      * Homogeneity is the big assumtion: "Cosmological Principle"

        - Light-cone: how far we can see; homogeneous within that

2. Extrapolating expansion backward

   A. Observations give current scale a(now) and its slope VS time a'(now)

   B. Extrapolations can lead to finitely-old and infinitely-old universes

   C. Another observation: space is black (1744, Olber 1826)

      * Uniformly distributed stars appear to us in shells whose surface area
        scales as r^2 and intensity as 1/r^2

        - Superposition should therefore diverge (or at least be as bright as
          the surface of a star, since every line of sight terminates on a star)

      * Edgar Allen Poe _Eureka_ (1848)

	"Were the succession of stars endless, then the background of the sky
	would present us an uniform luminosity, like that displayed by the
	Galaxy --- since there could be absolutely no point, in all that
	background, at which would not exist a star.

        (list of potential solutions)

	"...or, lastly, from the mere interval being so vast, that the electric
	tidings of their presence in Space, have not yet --- through the lapsing
	myriads of years --- been enabled to traverse that interval?"

        In other words, star-shining had to start at some point (draw line on
        light-cone): universe may be infinite in extent but there hasn't been
        enough time for the light to get to us

   D. To extrapolate quantitatively, one needs a theory of gravity (a theory of
      how motion is related to matter density)

[keep this derivation]

   E. Because matter is diffuse and non-relativistic, we can use Newton's
      theory: m x'' = F = G m M / x^2 for x(t)

      * Thm: no force inside a radially-symmetric shell

      * Thm: force due to a radially-symmetric distribution is equal to the
             force due to an equally-massive point

      * Construct a sphere that grows with matter density and consider force on
        particles on the surface --> r''(t) = -4/3 pi G r(t) rho(t) (A)

      * The total mass inside the sphere is constant: d(rho 4/3 pi r^3)/dt = 0
        -->  rho(t) propto 1/r(t)^3 (B)

      * Combine: r''(t) propto -4/3 pi G / r(t)^2 (C)  -->  r(t) propto t^2/3

        - add to a VS t plot (identifying a and r)

      * Recession speed (a'(0)/a(0) = 2/3 t^-1 = 2.3 +/- 0.3 x 10^-18 /s) -->
        age of the universe (2.9 x 10^17 s = 9.1 billion years)
	("H_0 = 72 +/- 8 km/s per Mpc (2001 Hubble Key Project)")

3. Expansion in General Relativity

   A. Source for gravity is now energy density, rather than mass

      * energy density comes in two forms: mass (E_mass = m c^2) and kinetic
        energy of constituent particles

        - Rotating planet attracts more than a stationary one; any large energy
          reserve is equivalent to mass: inhabitants could use energy resource
          to turn gold into lead (heavier) or create stockpiles of matter and
          antimatter, but planet's gravitational pull is unaffected

      * Small correction: typical galactic velocity (our own) is 600 km/s; this
	is a correction to the mass density of 4 x 10^-6 (p/mc = 2 x 10^-3)

      * Becomes relevant before about t = 20,000 years when ambient light
        contributed more to energy density than matter (tiny fraction of cosmic
        history, but the first fraction!)
	(Lookback time = 2/3 H_0^-1 (1 - (1+z)^-2/3) with redshift of 6000.)

   B. GR has a greater impact on our interpretation of a(t) than its calculation
      Reinterpretation of the meaning of "acceleration due to gravity"

      * Analyze a simple physics event: I drop a piece of chalk

        - First impose coordinate system to talk about the event quantitatively:
          y VS t (draw parabolic arc down) y_chalk(t) = -1/2 g t^2

	- y_chalk(0) didn't have to be 0; that was a choice.  In fact, I was
          free to choose any y offset, any t offset, or even...

        - Y VS t has chalk going up and down Y_chalk(t) = -1/2 g t^2 + v t; the
          coordinate transformation depends on t (linearly): Y = y + v t

        - Once the chalk's path is expressed in a coordinate system, Newton's
          law of gravity is a differential equation on y_chalk(t) or Y_chalk(t)
	  y_chalk''(t) = -g

      * Einstein wanted a theory of gravity in which only local properties
        matter: in this event, we expect the chalk to fall because we know that
        there's an Earth just under it.  But the chalk doesn't know about Earth
        until it hits it; moreover, riders on the chalk "feel" weightless.

        - He wanted to describe chalk's "natural" coordinate system this way:
          horizontal motion with yogh_chalk(t) = 0 (yogh = y + 1/2 g t^2)

	- If you're allowed to do this, you're not going to find a law of
          gravity like Newton's, since the description of the chalk's path is as
          unconstrained as the choice of coordinate systems

        - So instead of finding an equation that relates paths to their
          derivatives, Einstein found an equation that relates mass-energy
          density at a point to curvature at that point

        - Space-time occupied by Earth is curved, space-time far from Earth is
          not, everything in between makes up the difference so that the
          manifold in which we live is differentiable
          (Not just curvature between two space dimensions, curvature between a
          space dimension and a time dimension)
	  nonzero curvature --> nontrivial geodesics

        - Yogh coordinate system is natural because it is the one in which
          coordinate lines follow geodesics
	  y VS t geodesics bend down; I don't know how to draw that as a
          manifold

      * An embeddable case: homogeneous, expanding gas: the Universe!

        - Reinterpret a(t): scale of the slow-down of galactic expansion under
	  gravity; in GR, natural coordinates leave galaxies at rest, so a(t)
	  describes expansion of coordinate system
          (The comoving sphere in the derivation is now a stationary sphere)
	  (There's twice as much space now than there was 5 billion years ago)

        - To make this embeddable (visualizable), suppose one dimension of space
          is wrapped cylindrically (little to no evidence that this is true) so
          that east end is identified with west end (paper cylinder) (Note
          that this is not itself curvature, space (alone) is flat in this case)

        - Since there's more space at later times, the space-time manifold is
          like a cone (demonstrate)
          The geodesics, on which the galaxies lie, diverge

[refer back to derivation]

   C. Extrapolating expansion rate in the first 20,000 years, using GR

      * Consider energy density dominated by ambient light

      * rho(t) in (A) is now energy density: from homogeneity, as much light
        leaves the sphere as enters it, so (A) is unchanged in form

      * (B) needs modification: as space expands, not only does energy density
        scale with volume, but wavelengths are redshifted

	- Standing wave on cylindrical Universe: wavelength scales with a(t)

        - Total scaling is d/dt(rho a^4) = 0  -->  rho(t) propto 1/a(t)^4

      * (C) becomes a''(t) propto -1 / a(t)^3  -->  a(t) propto t^1/2

      * Our cylindrical Universe starts out shaped like a radio dish

        - It even has a differentiable point at t = 0.  Isn't that nice?  (It
          won't last...)

4. Doubts about the Very Beginning

   A. The Universe having a beginning can, in principle, introduce a problem
      with causality (and it does)

      * Draw worldlines of galaxies in natural (yogh) coordinates: wall at t=0,
        light-cone extending back from t=now (10 billion years)

      * Wavy line at t=400,000 years before which matter is in plasma state
        (glowing ultraviolet), afterwards atomic gas (transparent)

[projector]

      * We can see this glow: it's almost perfectly uniform
        It took 40 years of fine measurements to see the deviations: 1 in 10^5

[both?]

      * Add little light-cones at surface of plasma: they don't overlap.  They
        would overlap if extended well below t=0, but that's the Beginning

[chalkboard]

   B. In curved space-time, light-cones aren't cones (they're trumpets)

      * Speed of light = c = a(t) dx/dt (depending on which side of the equation
        you put a(t), you can think of space expanding with a constant speed of
        light, or fixed space with a slowing speed of light: galaxies look
        further away with time because light is taking longer to get to us...)

      * distance covered by light = int_r{there}^0{here} dx =
        c int_t{then}^t_0{now} dt' / a(t')

      * a(t) propto t^2/3 yields distance propto 3 c (t_0^1/3 - t^1/3)
        a(t) propto t^1/2 yields distance propto 2 c (t_0^1/2 - t^1/2)

      * Light-cones reach for each other but they still have finite support (so
        to speak), and they're still way far apart.

   C. We've opened the door to a way out: what if a(t) had some extreme shape
      very early on?  Light-cones might extend enough to overlap...

      * Consider, for instance, a(t) propto t^p p >= 1

        - c int_t^t_0 dt' / t^p = / c (1-p) (t_0^(1-p) - t^(1-p)  for p > 1
                                  \ c (ln t_0 - ln t)             for p = 1

        - Light-cones diverge as t -> 0: they overlap for sure!

      * Or even consider this: a(t) propto e^t

        - c int_t^t_0 dt' / e^t = c (e^-t - e^-t_0)

	- Light-cones don't diverge, but a(t) doesn't have a beginning!
          Light-cones will overlap in the t < 0 past

        - (Radio dish with a long mount)

   D. Changing a(t) at very early times requires a new type of matter:
      speculative particle physics

   E. This problem is usually solved by an exponential that both turns on and
      off, and is numerically large enough to superimpose the light-cones
      ("Inflation Models"): this will only homogenize a patch of the Universe,
      but a patch larger than we can see

5. Turn-of-the-Century Developments

   A. Study of the temperature distribution of the plasma phase has become a
      precision science

      * Spacial curvature is zero to two decimal places (with homogeneity
        assumtion, space could have constant curvature)

      * Age of the Universe is 13.7 +/- 0.2 billion years

   B. Hubble diagrams (recession velocity VS distance) are beginning to "reach
      around the bend" and experimentally observe the second derivative of a(t)

      * We expect: a(t) = b t^2/3 a'(t)/a = 2/3 1/t > 0 a''(t)/a = -2/9 t^-2 < 0

      * We observe: a *positive* second derivative!

      * We've already seen a theoretical a''(t) > 0 in the very early universe,
        this is an experimental measurement of a''(t) > 0 now.

      * Calls for a new type of matter component, relevant today.  a''(t) > 0
        implies that the dominant matter component has negative pressure or
        negative energy density or both (therefore exotic) since it is causing
        space to be pushed apart

      * "Cosmological constant" is a ready-made explaination: it's a constant
        that enters the GR equation through integration

	- Lagrangian = int Action --> R_munu - 1/2 R g_munu + Lambda_1 g_munu =
          Lambda_2 T_munu where Lambda_1,2 are Lagrange multipliers

	- Lambda_2 = 8 pi G_N to agree with Newton in the limit.

	- If Lambda_1 g_munu is small and non-zero, move it to the right-hand
          side and interpret it as an energy density: it has the form
	            /rho 0 0 0 \                    / 1  0  0  0 \
	  T_munu = (  0  p 0 0  ) = Omega_Lambda_1 (  0 -1  0  0  )
	           (  0  0 p 0  )                  (  0  0 -1  0  )
	            \ 0  0 0 p /                    \ 0  0  0 -1 /
          so the pressure is negative.

        - An Omega_Lambda_1 term will give a(t) propto e^t

6. A little more Poe

   A. "And, in fact, astronomers, without at any time reaching the idea here
      suggested, seem to have been approximating it... that is to say, from a
      consideration of Matter as they find it, they reach a conclusion at which
      I deductively arrive. That so pregnant a suggestion as the one quoted
      should have been permitted to remain so long unfruitful, is, nevertheless,
      a mystery which I find it difficult to fathom."

   B. Unfortunately, what he was discussing in the previous paragraph was
      something akin to a Big Crunch, which this observation of acceleration
      makes untenable... perhaps instead we should end with this quote:

   C. "It is as a Poem only that I wish this work to be judged after I am dead."
