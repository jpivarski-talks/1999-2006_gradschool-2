{\huge Calibration Project: Detector Alignment}

\begin{quote}
  After the detectors have been moved into position to mm accuracy, we
  need to know {\emph where} they are to $\mu$m accuracy to precisely
  reconstruct a track.
\end{quote}

This is a plot I made to demonstrate a Toy Monte Carlo to investigate
stretching and squishing of the central drift chamber, and its effect
on track reconstruction.

%% (You're looking at an $e^+ e^- \to e^+ e^-$ event in the XY plane.
%% Blue tracks are reality, red are misreconstruction due to
%% unaccounted-for distortions in detector shape.)

%% \begin{itemize}
%%   \normalsize

%%   \item The physics event of choice is $e^+ e^- \to e^+ e^-$ where you
%%   get two back-to-back tracks, coming from the origin (blue).  This is
%%   an XY-projection.  The tracks are slightly curved because of the
%%   magnetic field.

%%   \item The 31-layer detector is modelled here with three
%%   representative layers.  The track-layer intersections (blue) are
%%   where the measurements took place in real space.

%%   \item The dashed layers and red points represent unaccounted-for
%%   distortions in the detector shape.

%%   \item I did an incorrect fit to the incorrect points (red lines) to
%%   see what effect these distortions would have on
%%   na\"ievely-reconstructed tracks.

{\huge Thesis project: measure yield of $e^+ e^- \to \Upsilon$} \\
\mbox{\hspace{4.5cm} ($b$-quark, $\bar{b}$-quark bound state)}

\vspace{1cm}

The beam energy of $e^+ e^-$ was set to the mass of the $\Upsilon$
bound state, and we measure the cross-section $e^+ e^- \to \Upsilon$.
The beam energy was varied to map out the lineshape of the resonance.
The yield is

\vspace{0.5cm}

\[ \int d\mbox{\sc Energy} \ \sigma(e^+ e^- \to \Upsilon) =
   \int d\mbox{\sc Energy} \ \frac{\sigma(e^+ e^- \to \Upsilon \to \mbox{hadrons})}
        {{\mathcal B}(\Upsilon \to \mbox{hadrons})} \]

%% Interfering effects:
%% \begin{itemize}

%%   \item Breit-Wigner (Lorentzian) lineshape is convoluted with a
%%   spread in beam energies that is an order of magnitude wider.  (Good
%%   thing I'm only interested in the area!)

%%   \item Beam electrons can radiate a photon before interacting
%%     (calculable QED process), gives the lineshape a high-energy tail.

%%   \item I measure $e^+ e^- \to \Upsilon \to \mbox{hadrons}$, and
%%   there's also a process $e^+ e^- \to \mbox{hadrons}$ without the
%%   intermediate resonance.  This process is less dependent on energy,
%%   and appears as an underlying constant term in the $\sigma$ vs.\ {\sc
%%   Energy} plot.

  Carlos.

  \item We gave the data-taking procedure to \cesr, since they control
  the energy of the beams.  I stayed up all night watching the data
  come in.

  \item The data was processed (hits $\to$ tracks) by the Pass2
  committee, since this is a major computational challenge (large
  volume).  I studied systematic errors.

  \item \ldots I'm still studying systematic errors.

{\huge A Systematic Error: Beam-Gas Collisions}

\vspace{0.25cm}

We want to measure the process where $e^+$ and $e^-$ actually collide,
but sometimes this happens:

\vspace{0.25cm}

\begin{center}
  \epsfig{file=beamgas.eps, width=\linewidth}
\end{center}

\vspace{0.5cm}

How do we remove these from our sample?

\vspace{0.5cm}

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{p{0.29\linewidth} | p{0.31\linewidth} | p{0.3\linewidth} }
    What to do & Why this might work & Why it doesn't \\\hline

    Remove events with high $\left| \Sigma \vec{p} \cdot \hat{z} \right|$ &
      The gas atoms are at rest, so there is net momentum &
      Good events also have a wide $p_z$ distribution, because you
      don't see neutrinos \\

    Remove events with \mbox{$E_{\mbox{\small visible}}$ $\ll
      E_{\mbox{\small beam}}$} &
      Most particles pass undetected down the beam pipe &
      We do this, but you can't cut hard enough without losing data \\

    Find XYZ location of primary vertex &
      Good events only come from the collision point &
      Now you're on to something\ldots \\

I developed a robust primary vertex-finding algorithm and plotted
where all the events in data come from:

\vspace{0.5cm}

  \vspace{-0.25cm} \epsfig{file=cuts_illustration5.eps, width=0.9\linewidth} \vspace{-1.1cm}\\
\end{center}

\vspace{1cm}

\begin{itemize}

  \item Collision events are inside the red box

  \item Beam-gas events form a long strip along the beam

  \item Beam-wall collisions happen at 2 cm (where the beam pipe is)

  \item Cosmic rays are ``vertexed'' just about anywhere

  \item Some beam-halo particles interact in the denser parts of the
  silicon detector

\end{itemize}

\vspace{1cm}

{\huge Final Beam-Gas Handling Strategy:}

\vspace{0.5cm}

We extrapolate beam-gas level into the cut region (red box) and
subtract.
