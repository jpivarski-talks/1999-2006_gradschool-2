<h3>Superimposition of the Fits</h3>

<p>It seems fairly clear that it is the energy which is fluctuating
from the value given by the energy program, not the hadronic
cross-section from pass1.

<p>The SEN #2 value is a likely culprit. This goes into the energy
determination as a multiplicative factor, rather than a additive
shift. Therefore, I should check to see if all the points from all
weeks fit a single curve more readily if their energies are corrected
multiplicatively or additively.
