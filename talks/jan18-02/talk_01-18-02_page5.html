<h3>Estimation of Systematic Error</h3>

<p>The derivative of the distribution at the -2 MeV point is <b>0.870 nb/MeV</b>.

The 0.43616 nb deviation (122076), if all the systematic error is in
the energy measurement, corresponds to a maximum energy jump of
<b>0.5013 MeV between datasets</b>. The biggest deviation seen within
a dataset is the 0.2548 nb jump between 122542 and 122556, which
corrseponds to an energy jump of <b>0.2929 MeV within a dataset</b>.

<p>The jumps between datasets don't affect the final result, since the
area will be determined by averaging the areas of the individual scans
together.

<p>Simulations of fits that include random unseen energy jumps with
0.3 MeV as a <b>typical</b> size suffer from a 1.5% systematic
uncertainty. Since seven fits are averaged together, the average
suffers form a 1.5% / sqrt(7) = <b>0.57% systematic uncertainty</b>.
This is still very rough, efficiencies have not yet been considered,
etc.
