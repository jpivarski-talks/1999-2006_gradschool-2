INTRODUCTION

High-precision lattice QCD

  * Explain method, history, situation, and "unquenching"

  * Ratio plots; 2 mass measurements are CLEO 1st & 2nd observations;
    m_{B_c} and m_{\Omega} may be added

  * For the rest of this talk, I'll refer to LQCD as a tool for
    extracting fundumental physics from decay rates
    but first I want to emphasize that this breakthrough amounts to
    finally understanding the strong force quantitatively

LQCD for flavor physics: decay rates

  * Matrix elements (transition probabilities) instead of eigenvalues
    (masses)

  * Typically, two particles must meet at a point for the transition
    to occur, so this probes fine-grain structure:
    |psi(0,0,0)|^2 in real life, lattice structure in simulation

  * The a -> 0 extrapolation is more challenging

Main goal: B meson decay constant (f_B)

  * Why?  B\bar{B} mixing could tightly constrain V_td

    \Delta m_B = (known) (f_B^2 B_B) |V_td|^2 = 0.502 \pm 0.007 ps^-1 (1.4%)

    if QCD factors f_B and B_B could be determined.  (V_td is a CKM
    matrix element, a fundumental parameter of SM that constrains CP
    asymmetry measurement.)

  * If you are familiar with the unitarity triangle, this corresponds
    to shrinking the B_d band (20%) to a narrow annulus

  * f_B can't be measured directly, as B+ -> l nu rate is too slow to
    be observable

  * LQCD is the most promising technique for calculating f_B and B_B

The program: LQCD calculates f_B and B_B and predicts related,
verifiable quantities

             heavy-light    heavy-heavy
  * bottom       f_B        \Gamma_ee(U)
            (theory only)   (th vs expt)

     charm       f_D
             (th vs expt)

  * Leptonic decays of strongly-bound mesons expose decay constants
    (diagrams, label f_D, "f_U", V_cd(known to 1.3%), 1(known))

For the remainder of this talk, I will present

  * a high-precision measurement (1.5-2.5%) of \Gamma_ee for
    U(1S,2S,3S) (CLEO-III)

  * a first statistically-significant observation (6.6 sigma) of D ->
    mu nu, which determines f_B to 7.6% (CLEO-c)

  * future confrontations between theory and experiment at CLEO-c

GAMMA_EE

Roadmap: table of contents and an indicator at the top of the screen

Measurement technique I

  * By definition, \Gamma_ee(Upsilon) is the decay rate of Upsilon to
    e+e- (in absense of other interactions): \Gamma_ee = \Gamma B_ee

  * It may seem that a measurement would consist of counting e+e-
    final states, but

    - this measures B_ee, which is one step removed from \Gamma_ee

    - \Gamma can't be measured directly (narrower than collider beam
      energy spread)

  * Alternative method: time-reversed process (diagrams), measure U
    production from e+e- beams (\Gamma_ee = ... \int \sigma dE)

Measurement technique II

  * dE integration can be accomplished by scanning U resonance (aerial
    view of CESR and cartoon on same slide): cross-section vs. energy

  * CLEO-III cut-away; point out silicon, drift chamber, and CsI
    calorimeter

  * Represent U production with hadronic decays (list cuts)

  * U decays to ee, mm, tt: multiply them back in with 1/(1-3 B_mm)
    (B_mm precisely measured at CLEO-III (3-4%))

Measurement technique III

  * Obtain \Gamma_ee from a fit to the resonance lineshape (cartoon)

    - Most background processes scale as 1/s

    - BW lineshape is convoluted with beam energy spread: does not
      affect *area* (== \Gamma_ee)

    - Also convoluted with ISR tail (e+e- -> U \gamma) which diverges;
      we remove this by

      . Constructing a fit function which is BW \otimes G \otimes ISR

      . Fitting measured points

      . Reading off BW area parameter

  * Definition of \Gamma_ee (ee -> U, U -> ee diagrams side-by-side)

    - ISR removed             FSR not represented by this measurement

    - Vacuum polarization: same in both cases, left in (6% effect)

  * Show fits and scan/off lumi for each

    - Analysis optimized for peak height and shape: background is 1/2
      q\bar{q}, 1/2 radiative bhabha (both scale as 1/s)

    - Compare with best lineshapes before CLEO-III

Backgrounds are well-controlled

  * Bottom of the sea plot, go line by line

  * We explicitly count and subtract cosmic rays and beam-gas

    - The paper plots: cosmic d_XY is better than beam-gas d_Z

Hadronic efficiency

  * Number of U = (U -> hadrons) / (1-3 Bmm)
    Hadronic e uncertainty (0.6%) > Bmm e uncertainty (0.2%)

  * Want to avoid using MC for hadronic e, as it assumes a
    hadronization model

  * Model-independent method for measuring hadronic e (1S):

    - Select U(2S) -> U(1S) pi+pi- events such that the pi+pi- alone
      guarantee inclusion in the dataset (sufficient for trigger)

    - Supplies an unbiased set of U(1S) events (includes invisibles
      like U -> nu\bar{nu} and even any BSM decays)

    - Count (#pass cuts)/(#total) for cut efficiencies

    - (Show the recoil mass plots for the unbiased case)

    - Efficiency is nearly 100%

  * For 2S, 3S hadronic e, most modes are unchanged

    - (Use MC for correction factor 1.x +- 0.x consistent with 1)

  * Main difference: U(nS) -> X U(n-1S), U(n-1S) -> e+e-, m+m-
    have zero efficiency

    - Mini-analysis to determine these branching fractions

Integrated Luminosity

  * Need to know integrated luminosity (amount of data) for each scan
    point

  * Divide problem into relative int lumis (determine all up to a
    single constant) and absolute int lumi (determine the last
    constant)

  * Relative int lumis:

    - Count #e+e- -> \gamma\gamma at each scan point

    - Int lumi is proportional to #\gamma\gamma * beam energy^2

    - This is enough to plot cross-section vs energy, with
      cross-section in unknown units

  * Absolute int lumis:

    - Separate analysis involving e+e-, \gamma\gamma, m+m- final
      states

    - Blinded \Gamma_ee analysis by applying this correction at the
      very end

Cross-section stability

  * 500 measurements of cross-section (below resonance) are consistent
    with a single value

    - Pull distributions are unit Gaussians

    - Same is true if relative int lumit is measured by Bhabhas

    - This is a larger sample of data than the scan

Beam-energy measurement stability

  * Weekly scans were short and independent

  * Measurements alternated above and below resonance peak

  * Point of high slope was repeated in the scan

    - Energy measurement stability from consistency of that repeated
      point

    - 30 measurements, consistent with zero, yield upper limit of 0.07
      MeV

Fit results: SHOW fits, SAY "unit pull distributions"

Summary of uncertainties (just like last talk)

Preliminary results (just like last talk, with PDG plots)

  * (Note that this is the first precise measurement of \Gamma_ee(3S),
    which will add a sixth point to potential model fits.  Just as an
    aside.)

Comparison with theory

  * Theoretical result is incomplete

    - Equation 23: missing Z_match is lattice current -> real current
      renormalization, and therefore includes discretization
      corrections

    - For now, we can compare *ratio* of U(2S)/U(1S) with theory

    - (Add theory extrapolation to plot and update reference)

    - Chiral extrapolation on left, lattice spacing dependence on
      right

    - \Gamma_ee(1S,2S,3S) calculations will ultimately be ~10%
      accurate, but ratios will be few percent

D TO MU NU

Similar roadmap

Introduction

  * Very different kind of analysis: discovery, statistics-limited

  * CLEO-c (show cut-away, point out SI -> ZD) with 281 pb^-1 at
    psi(3770) (produces D\bar{D} pairs)

  * Identify D+ on one side of the event and look for signal:
    D- -> mu nu (or charge conjugate)

    - Event picture of a typical D- -> mu nu

    - Six tag modes, following the MARK-III procedure very closely

Event selection

  * Tag modes are fully reconstructed (each track identified,
    pions/kaons cleanly distinguished by RICH detector, no
    unidentified CsI showers > 250 MeV)

    - Plot from updated paper

  * Muon deposits < 300 MeV in CsI calorimeter (cuts out 60% of pions)

  * Neutrino is reconstructed from missing mass^2 (define)

    - Plot from updated paper

    - Large peak is from D+ -> K^0 pi, where the K^0 is lost:
      0.25 GeV^2 is the mass^2 of the K^0

    - D+ -> mu nu (and conjugates) peak near zero (previous
      measurement at BES saw 1 event)

Backgrounds

  * Table of background contributions (MC) (use updated paper text)

    - All background rates are small: 2.8 background / 47.2 signal

Systematic uncertainties characterize MC accuracy (table)

  * Clean environment, well-understood detector, tested MC
    --> 2% systematic

  * Statistical uncertainty is 15%

Final results (quote paper, make a PDG plot out of the predictions)

FUTURE

Return to f_D, f_B, \Gamma_ee table

  * Add a dimension: f_Ds (th vs expt), f_Bs (theory only)

    - Theory errors cancel in f_Bs/f_B, so measure
      \Delta_m_Bs/\Delta_m_B for V_ts/V_td

    - CLEO-c will measure f_Ds, and therefore f_Ds/f_D

    - LQCD does the same and extrapolates to B meson (in fact, more
      errors cancel in "Grinstein ratio": (f_Bs/f_Bd)/(f_Ds/f_D))

    - CESR/CLEO is already optimizing an energy point for Ds
      production

  * Semi-leptonic decays: q^2 dependence of f_D (big diagram)

    - Difficult to measure far above threshold (CLEO-III plots)
      (K l nu peaks under pi l nu)

    - Easier at threshold (pastedGraphic; Fig1-a,b CLNS 05-1906)
      (This is only 55.8/281 of the currently available data: work in
      progress)

SUMMARY

  * Precision LQCD is a breakthrough in its own right

  * As a tool, it can extract fundumental parameters from decay rate
    measurements

  * Some contacts with experiment, such as \Gamma_ee, f_D, f_Ds, f(q^2)
    Can use these to

    - Check the validity the calculations in different quark pair
      settings

    - Extrapolate experimental measurements, such as f_D and f_Ds/f_D,
      to higher quark masses
