Title: Gamma_ee and f_D: Testing the Flavors of Lattice QCD

Abstract:

One of the major obstacles to unraveling the CKM matrix is our
ignorance of the strong force.  Quantum Chromodynamics has been
accepted as the explaination of the strong force for nearly twenty
years, but its non-perturbative nature at low energies makes some
problems difficult or impossible to solve, among them the decay
constant $f_B$ in $B$-$\bar{B}$ mixing.  Precision lattice QCD is a
promising technique, having successfully predicted or reproduced about
a dozen masses and widths, but we would like to test the theory in a
regime relevant for $B$ physics.  I will discuss two CLEO results that
are each only one quark removed from the elusive $f_B$, and present
some early comparisons with the lattice.
